I think nature's imagination Is so much greater than man's, she's never going to let us relax.

Man masters nature not by force but by understanding. This is why science has succeeded where magic failed: because it has looked for no spell to cast over nature.

The reality we can put into words is never reality itself.

___***___
What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.

___***___
The problems of language here are really serious. We wish to speak in some way about the structure of the atoms. But we cannot speak about atoms in ordinary language.
... Werner Heisenberg

___***___
I think that modern physics has definitely decided in favor of Plato. In fact the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense; they are forms, ideas which can be expressed unambiguously only in mathematical language.
... Werner Heisenberg

___***___
Whether we like it or not, modern ways are going to alter and in part destroy traditional customs and values.
... Werner Heisenberg

___***___
The atoms or elementary particles themselves are not real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts.

The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land, to add something to the extent and the solidity of our possessions.

===================================================================================

___***___
If we look at the way the universe behaves, quantum mechanics gives us fundamental, unavoidable indeterminacy, so that alternative histories of the universe can be assigned probability.
... Murray Gell-Mann

___***___
If someone says that he can think or talk about quantum physics without becoming dizzy, that shows only that he has not understood anything whatever about it.
... Murray Gell-Mann

___***___
Sometimes the probabilities are very close to certainties, but they're never really certainties.
... Murray Gell-Mann

___***___
What is especially striking and remarkable is that in fundamental physics a beautiful or elegant theory is more likely to be right than a theory that is inelegant.
... Murray Gell-Mann

While many questions about quantum mechanics are still not fully resolved, there is no point in introducing needless mystification where in fact no problem exists. Yet a great deal of recent writing about quantum mechanics has done just that.
... Murray Gell-Mann

== Julian Schwinger
===================================================================================

___***___
Is the purpose of theoretical physics to be no more than a cataloging of all the things that can happen when particles interact with each other and separate? Or is it to be an understanding at a deeper level in which there are things that are not directly observable (as the underlying quantized fields are) but in terms of which we shall have a more fundamental understanding?

An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.

___***___
We must be clear that when it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images and establishing mental connections.

And a new philosophy emerged called quantum physics, which suggest that the individualâ€™s function is to inform and be informed. You really exist only when youâ€™re in a field sharing and exchanging information. You create the realities you inhabit.

I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have crated so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.

Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the free human mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we live, and it gives us an understanding of our place in the universe.
... Neil deGrasse Tyson

The very nature of science is discoveries, and the best of those discoveries are the ones you don't expect.
... Neil deGrasse Tyson

Somehow it's O.K. for people to chuckle about not being good at math. Yet if I said, 'I never learned to read,' they'd say I was an illiterate dolt.
... Neil deGrasse Tyson

Physics is the only profession in which prophecy is not only accurate but routine.
... Neil deGrasse Tyson

If God is the mystery of the universe, these mysteries, we're tackling these mysteries one by one. If you're going to stay religious at the end of the conversation, God has to mean more to you than just where science has yet to tread.
... Neil deGrasse Tyson

We define ourselves as intelligent. That's odd, because we're doing the definition - We're creating our own definition and saying, 'We are intelligent!'
